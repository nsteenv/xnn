Framework for deep neural networks training on multiple GPUs

This is framework that I wrote in 2014/2015, figured it might be good to get it out here finally. It is mostly inspired by cuda-convnet2 project from Alex Krizhevsky (akrizhevsky), but all code is rewritten by me.

It is still work in progress, so you will find lot of TODOs (and bugs probably).
