Framework for deep neural networks training on multiple GPUs

This is framework that I wrote in 2014/2015, figured it might be good to get it out here finally. It is mostly inspired by cuda-convnet2 project from Alex Krizhevsky (akrizhevsky), but all code is rewritten by me. Contains Visual Studio solution for Windows build and accompanying tests.

It is still work in progress, so you will find lot of TODOs (and bugs probably).
